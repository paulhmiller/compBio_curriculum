Computational Biology Curriculum
================================

Purpose: to list material and courses to help one become proficient at manipulating high content biological datasets, to a level of being comfortable taking an job in computational biology.

## Overview
- Use Github for as many things as possible
- Keep in mind when best to use R vs Python vs bash vs other
- Learn this like anything else: it’s just time on the water

## Tasks
- Become familar with the [unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- Edx: Genomics Data Science
- Edx: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
- Data Carpentry’s online genomic, data management & analysis workshops
- Come up with a research question and project, execute it, and write it up
- Play in Rosalind

## Random tasks to consider later
- High cluster analysis
- Use Amazon EC2, virtual computer/instance
- Use high computing cluster
- Do some modeling: cox proportional, kaplan, clustering/PCA, ridge/lasso regression (elastic net, glmnet)
- Big memory, parallel
- Normalize some raw RNA-Seq data
- Analyze some microarray data
- Browse data on SRA
- Use SRA toolkit

## Additional online learning sources
- Stanford’s [Biochem 218](http://biochem218.stanford.edu/)
- EBI [online training](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/)
